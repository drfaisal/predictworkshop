### Installing materials locally

We will be using RStudio Cloud for the workshop, but if you would like
to install the required packages and course materials, we have an R
package called
{[predictworkshop](https://github.com/drfaisal/predictworkshop)} to
help you do that! You can install
{[predictworkshop](https://github.com/drfaisal/predictworkshop)}
from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("drfaisal/predictworkshop")
```

Once youâ€™ve installed the package, install the workshop with

``` r
predictworkshop::install_workshop()
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place
like your Desktop. You can also tell `install_workshop()` exactly where
to put the materials:

``` r
predictworkshop::install_workshop("a/path/on/your/computer")
```
